# Luma-Academia 📚  

Welcome to **Luma-Academia**, a **public archive** of all my **computer science notes** since I started using **Obsidian**. This repository serves as a structured and evolving collection of concepts, insights, and learnings from my university journey.  

## 📖 About This Archive  
- 🏛 **Field:** Computer Science  
- 📝 **Format:** Markdown (Obsidian-compatible)  
- 📆 **Started:** Beginning of 2025. (Meaning these notes are missing some first year subjects)
- 🔍 **Topics Covered:** Algorithms, Data Structures, Software Engineering, Operating Systems, Networks, AI, and more  

## 🚀 Why This Exists  
I created **Luma-Academia** to:  
✔ **Document my learning** in an organized and structured way  
✔ **Share knowledge** with other students, researchers, and self-learners  
✔ **Build a personal knowledge base** that I can reference anytime  
✔ **Contribute to open learning** by making high-quality CS notes accessible  

## 🏗 Structure  
I use alot of tags to organise my files along with folders. To be able to see these tags you'll have to download the files and put them into obsidian. But the general structure is Lecture > Notes > Definitions


## 🎯 Who Can Benefit?  
- 🎓 **Students** looking for structured CS notes  
- 💻 **Developers** wanting a quick reference for core CS concepts  
- 🔍 **Researchers** interested in summarized academic content  
- 🤖 **Self-learners** exploring computer science topics  

## 📜 License  
Feel free to **use, modify, and share** these notes, but kindly **give credit** where due. 🚀
