### What is a Logarithms?

![[Pasted image 20250320111159.png]]

> Logs (short for **logarithms**) are just another way of thinking about exponents.

#### Think of it like this:
If you ask:
"What power of 2 gives me 8?"  The answer is **3**, because: $2^3=8$

This means: $log‚Å°2(8)=3$

#### Breaking It Down:

- **Exponents:** You multiply a number by itself.
    - Example: $2^4=16$
- **Logs:** You ask, "What power do I need?"
    - Example: $log2(16)=4$ because $2^4=16$
